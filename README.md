Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using an XGBoost regression model. The dataset includes a collection of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

Features
Data preprocessing and exploration using NumPy and Pandas
Visualization of data relationships with a correlation heatmap
XGBoost regression model for accurate predictions
Model evaluation using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Dependencies
NumPy
Pandas
XGBoost
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
Explore data relationships with a correlation heatmap.
Build and train the XGBoost regression model.
Evaluate the model using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error.
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts house prices.

Results
The project achieved an MSE of 10.01 and MAE of 2.18 on the test data, indicating accurate predictions of house prices.

Visualizations
The project includes visualizations of the correlation heatmap and a plot of actual vs. predicted house prices using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
